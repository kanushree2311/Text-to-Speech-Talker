# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi I made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b> TechWave </b>.

## About the project :
This program demonstrates the use of the pyttsx3 third-party module. Any message you enter will be spoken out loud by your operating system's text-to-speech capabilities. 
The program can also read aloud the text file given the file path. It even askes before hand which voice the user wants whether of a Female or a Male. The program continues 
until the user wants to exit. Although computer-generated speech is an incredibly complex branch of computer science, the pyttsx3 module provides an easy interface for it. 

<br>
## Tech Stack used :
Object Oriented Programming with Python
pyttsx3 (python library)

##How the program works :
Firstly, it askes if You want simple text converted to speech or read aloud a file.
Secondly, it askes which voice would you like the text to be narrated, in Female or Male voice.
Thirdly, if you choose 'simple text' it will ask the message  to be converted to speech or if you choose 'file' it will ask for it's directory (location/path of the file).
Fourthly, the message will be spoken by your operating system in your chosen voice.
Lasty, it will ask if you want to continue or not.
